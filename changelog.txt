- Added better HDR handling to shaders, should result in less TUFX breakage in HDR mode
- Added new Billboard (Additive Directional) shader - a billboard that fades out when away from a specific angle
- Added waterfall-spotlight-1 and waterfall-floodlight-1 templates
- Added new Light controller (link effects to a light intensity)
- Added two new flare textures to use

v0.2.6
------
- Added new guard for multiple misconfigured modules that should break the game less when there is a critical configuration error

v0.2.5
------
- Fixed randomness values for shaders being lost sometime in the past

v0.2.4

- Fixed some log messages that didn't have a log level

v0.2.3
------
- Fixed DDS format of some flare textures

v0.2.2
------
- More less logspam
- Future improvements

- Added compiled shaders for Linux and OSX (somewhat experimental)

v0.2.0
------
- Split configuration for Restock and Restock+ parts into a different mod
- Fixed plume scaling in the case where multiple plume parent transforms have different scales (i.e. nuPoodle)
- Fixed a couple of minor bugs
- Renamed/restructured templates:
 - waterfall-hydrolox-lower-1: lower stage hydrolox engine 
 - waterfall-hydrolox-lower-2: lower stage hydrolox engine, energetic, orange
 - waterfall-hydrolox-rs25-1: lower stage hydrolox engine based on SSME 
 - waterfall-hydrolox-upper-1: upper stage hydrolox engine, suitable for orbital engines
 - waterfall-kerolox-lower-1: Reddish kerolox lower stage engine, suitable for energetic lifting engine
 - waterfall-kerolox-lower-2: orangeish kerolox lower stage engine, suitable for energetic lifting engine
 - waterfall-kerolox-lower-3: extra burny kerolox lower stage engine, suitable for energetic lifting engine
 - waterfall-kerolox-sustainer-1: reddish kerolox lower stage engine, somewhat based on Titan 3 engine
 - waterfall-kerolox-upper-1: Reddish kerolox, suitable for generic upper stage engine
 - waterfall-kerolox-upper-2:Red/white kerolox, suitable for low thrust upper stage engine
 - waterfall-ntr-lh2-1: LH2-based nuclear rocket engine
